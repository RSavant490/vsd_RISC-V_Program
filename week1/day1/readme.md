# Day 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis Using Sky130 Library

This repository captures the hands-on flow of setting up, compiling, and simulating a Verilog design using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** and visualizing the results with **GTKWave**.  
The example used is a **2-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX)**.

The aim of this session is to understand:

- What a simulator does in RTL design.
- The role of a design file and a testbench.
- How to run simulations using iverilog and debug waveforms in GTKWave.

## What is a Simulator, Design, and Testbench?

**Design File (RTL):**  
Contains the actual logic implementation of the hardware (e.g., `good_mux.v` for a 2-to-1 multiplexer).

**Testbench File:**  
Provides inputs and expected behavior to verify the design (e.g., `tb_good_mux.v`).  
Testbenches **do not synthesize** into hardware.  
They simulate stimulus and check the response of the design.

**Simulator:**  
A tool (like Icarus Verilog) that takes both design + testbench files, compiles them, and produces a simulation output.  
Generates a **VCD (Value Change Dump)** file that stores waveform data.  

The VCD can be viewed using **GTKWave** to confirm correct design behavior.

## Getting Started with iverilog
Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`) is a free and open-source Verilog simulation and synthesis tool. It allows you to compile Verilog design files along with testbenches to generate simulation output.

**Step 1 â€“ Set up the workshop repository:**

*Create a working folder*
```bash
mkdir vsd
cd vsd
````
*Clone the Sky130 workshop repo*
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
````
*Enter the repo*
```bash
cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop
````

**Explore the repo structure:**

* `my_lib/` â†’ Custom libraries.
* `lib/` â†’ Standard cell libraries.
* `verilog_files/` â†’ Verilog source codes and testbenches.

> We will focus on the Verilog MUX example inside `verilog_files/`.

## Lab: Simulating a 2-to-1 Multiplexer

**Step 1 â€“ Move to Verilog files folder:**

```bash
cd verilog_files
```

**Step 2 â€“ Compile design and testbench with iverilog:**

```bash
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```

> This generates an executable file `a.out`.

**Step 3 â€“ Run the simulation:**

```bash
./a.out
```

> This creates a waveform file `tb_good_mux.vcd`.

**Step 4 â€“ Open waveform in GTKWave:**

```bash
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

> This opens the signals in a graphical waveform viewer for analysis.

## Verilog Code Analysis

**`good_mux.v`** â†’ Implements a 2:1 multiplexer.

* Inputs: `a`, `b`, `sel`
* Output: `y`
* Code:
```verilog
module good_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
always @ (*)
begin
    if(sel)
        y <= i1;
    else 
        y <= i0;
end
endmodule
```

**`tb_good_mux.v`** â†’ Provides stimulus.

* Applies different combinations of `a`, `b`, and `sel`.
* Observes whether `y` follows the expected behavior.

> The waveforms in GTKWave confirm whether the design is functionally correct.

## Introduction to Yosys & Gate Libraries

* **Yosys** is an open-source tool for RTL synthesis.
* After simulation, the next step is **synthesis** â†’ converting RTL Verilog into a gate-level netlist using standard cell libraries (like Sky130).
* The `lib/` folder in the repo provides these libraries.

### Introduction to Yosys & Gate Libraries

**Yosys** is an open-source tool for RTL synthesis.  
After simulation, the next step is **synthesis** â†’ converting RTL Verilog into a gate-level netlist using standard cell libraries (like Sky130).  
The `lib/` folder in the repo provides these libraries.

### Basic Yosys Synthesis Flow for `good_mux.v`

```yosys
# Load standard cell library
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

# Read the RTL design
read_verilog good_mux.v

# Synthesize the top module
synth -top good_mux

# Map to standard cells
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

# Show the synthesized netlist graphically
show

# Export synthesized netlist to Verilog
write_verilog good_mux_netlist.v

# Optional: Open in text editor for inspection
# Note: Using gedit here instead of gvim
!gedit good_mux_netlist.v

````

### Handling RTLIL Process Warning

If you get a warning like:

```
Module good_mux contains RTLIL processes with sync rules...
Use "proc" to convert processes to logic networks and registers.
```

You can fix it by running:

```yosys
proc
write_verilog -noattr good_mux_netlist.v
!gedit good_mux_netlist.v
```

* `proc` converts internal RTLIL processes into logic networks (gates and registers) suitable for Verilog output.
* Using `-noattr` removes Yosys-specific attributes for a cleaner netlist.

> After this step, the generated Verilog netlist should be ready for gate-level simulation or further flow without warnings.

### Notes

* You can view your netlist at any point with the `show` command.
* The `.lib` file provides timing and cell information for Sky130 standard cells, which `abc` uses for mapping.
* This workflow ensures your RTL is safely converted into a synthesizable, gate-level netlist.
