## Intro & Context
This work is part of the RISC-V SoC Tapeout & skilling initiatives run by **VLSI System Design (VSD)**. VSD provides hands-on VLSI courses, workshops, and tapeout programs that train participants through the full RTL → GDSII flow and practical tapeout activities. VSD partners with academic institutions (including IIT Gandhinagar) to deliver industry-relevant training and real chip tapeout experience.

## VSD — Active course highlights
VSD offers many programs across fundamentals to advanced VLSI topics. Selected offerings include:
- **Starter & Foundation tracks** (basic VLSI, RTL design, SPICE/analog fundamentals). 
- **Workshops** (short, focused courses such as FPGA Fabric Design & Architecture).
- **Advanced & Tapeout programs** (SoC Labs / RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout, product-based skilling programs, and industry tool training).

## RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program — (SoC Labs)
**What it is:** SoC Labs is a long-format, hands-on tapeout program demonstrating a full tapeout cycle for a RISC-V Reference SoC. The program walks participants through RTL design, synthesis, physical design, signoff, and the tapeout process using commercial EDA tool flows and an SCL180nm / Synopsys-based flow (as described by the program materials).

**Duration & format**
- Typical cohort length: ~20 weeks (multi-month guided program, with lectures, labs, and group projects).

**Learning outcomes**
- End-to-end understanding of a SoC tapeout cycle (spec → RTL → synthesis → place & route → DRC/LVS signoff → GDSII → tape-out).
- Hands-on experience with SoC integration (processor core, peripherals, analog IP integration, memory setup).
- Exposure to commercial EDA flows and PDK integration (useful for real-world tapeouts).

**Prerequisites (typical)**
- Basic programming (C), digital logic and RTL familiarity, and some Linux/terminal comfort. (VSD starter/bridge modules cover gaps.)

**Target participants**
- Students, early-career engineers, and hobbyists seeking practical tapeout experience and SoC-level design exposure.

## How this repo maps to the course
- **Video summary / lecture notes**.  
- **Tool installation & verification** — documented with commands and screenshots (Yosys, Icarus/iverilog, GTKWave, ngspice, Magic).  
- **Hands-on labs & artifacts** — RTL, synthesis run results, netlists, and any layout/GDS artifacts (when available).  
- **Acknowledgement** — credits to VSD, Kunal Ghosh, and IIT Gandhinagar for the program and collaboration.

## Short acknowledgement
I am thankful to **Kunal Ghosh** and Team VSD for their vision and support in creating this learning ecosystem, and to **IIT Gandhinagar** for academic collaboration. The RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program provides a rare, hands-on chance to explore the full VLSI design flow — from RTL to GDSII — and I look forward to progressing through the weekly labs and tapeout exercises.
